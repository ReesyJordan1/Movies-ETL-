## **Movies-ETL**

#### Amazing Prime which is a platform for streaming movies and tv shows.  My task for Amazing Prime was to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. I needed to create one function that takes in three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

- #### First, I needed to create an ETL pipeline from raw data to a SQL database.
- #### Next, I extracted data from three sources using Python -Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data.
- #### Then, I cleaned and transformed data using Pandas.
- #### After that, I use regular expressions to parse data and to transform text into numbers.
- #### Finally, I loaded data with PostgreSQL.
